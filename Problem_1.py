# Problem 1

# If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

# Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.



# I'm not sure there is a way to confirm all multiples without checking each digit.
# This loop checks all digits:

for n in range(1, 1001):
