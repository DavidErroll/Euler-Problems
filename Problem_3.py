# Problem 3

# The prime factors of 13195 are 5, 7, 13 and 29.
# What is the largest prime factor of the number 600851475143?

# Quick comment:
# Since prime factorization is the basis of current encryption methods, I am confident that:
#   1. a brute-force loop of some type is necessary; and
#   2. people who know how to optimize code for speed will have written superior loops.


# Greatest prime factor is n/2


# Function to check if prime


# Seive all easy negatives


# Find k ** 2 <= x
