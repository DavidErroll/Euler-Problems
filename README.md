# Project Euler 'Solutions'

This is a repository of my (attempts at) solutions to the problems in [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/archives).

Since I have always enjoyed pure math and the truly elegant, pithy solutions to sometimes-apparently intractable problems, I thought that running through these could offer some enjoyable opportunities to expand my math knowledge while improving my coding.

## Format

Each problem file will likely include at least two blocks of code:
* my initial attempt at a solution; and
* at least one additional solution that presents
** more elegant math;
** more elegant code; or
** both.
